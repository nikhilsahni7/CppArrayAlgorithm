# Array Manipulation Program

This C++ program provides a basic implementation of an Array class with various operations like creating an array, inserting elements, deleting elements, getting the array size, mapping elements, finding elements, and sorting the array without using built in functions but instead creating our own array and functions...

## Features

- **Create Array:** Allows the user to input elements and displays the created array.

- **Insert in Array:** Inserts an element at a specified index and displays the updated array.

- **Delete from Array:** Deletes an element at a specified index and displays the array after deletion.

- **Get Size:** Displays the size of the array.

- **Map in Array:** Modifies the value at a specified index and displays the updated array.

- **Find in Array:** Searches for an element in the array and displays the index if found.

- **Sort in Array:** Sorts the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm.

## Usage

1. Enter the size of the array.
2. Choose the operation you want to perform by uncommenting the respective lines in the `main` function.
3. Compile and run the program.

## Notes

- The program uses basic algorithms for insertion, deletion, mapping, finding, and sorting, with opportunities for optimization.
